This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-cardata package of carData.  The
carData package provides datasets for the R Companion to Applied
Regression book. It was written by John Fox, Sanford Weisberg and Brad
Price.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'carData' to
'r-cran-cardata to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.
